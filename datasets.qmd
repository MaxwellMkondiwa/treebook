## Swiss banknote data

The Swiss banknote data contain measurements from 200 Swiss 1000-franc banknotes: 100 genuine (`y = 0`) and 100 counterfeit (`y = 1`). For R users, the data are conveniently available as the `banknote` data frame in package [treemisc](https://github.com/bgreenwell/treemisc), and can be loaded using

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bn <- treemisc::banknote
```
