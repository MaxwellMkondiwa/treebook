### Swiss banknote data

The Swiss banknote data (FIXME: ADD CITATION) contain measurements from 200 Swiss 1000-franc banknotes (100 genuine and 100 counterfeit). For R users, the data are conveniently available as the `banknote` data frame in package [treemisc](https://github.com/bgreenwell/treemisc).
