#### Errata for the 1st edition, first printing (June, 2022)

-   Page 9. At the top pf the page, "...polynomial modelpolynomial" should be "...polynomial model." (Thanks to @RaymondBalise)

-   Page 9. Just below the figure caption, "...MSE" should be "...MSE (mean squared error)." (Thanks to @RaymondBalise)

-   Page 22. In the last paragraph, "(red curve)" should be "(black curve)." (Thanks to @RaymondBalise)

-   Page 48. Just before the function at the bottom of the page, "...<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18148282/172916991-a153f5e8-0585-4ad6-9c2c-5f642bb53627.png" alt="image" width="70"/>" should be "...see `` ?`[` ``." (Thanks to @RaymondBalise)

-   Page 72. In the second to last paragraph, "...take $\mathcal{T}_0$ to be the left tree in Figure 2.12" should be "...take T_0 to be the left tree in Figure 2.13." (Thanks to @RaymondBalise);

-   Page 75. The phrase "...nodes $A_5$--$A_7$" is confusing (since the tree nodes are not labeled left to right and top to bottom) and should probably be changed to "...nodes $A_9$, $A_5$, and $A_3$".

-   Page 97. "...Cleveland dot plot displayed in Figure ??" should be "...Cleveland dot plot displayed in Figure 2.24. (Thanks to @RaymondBalise)

-   Page 128. Missing closing parentheses at the end of the first paragraph in Section 3.4.4.

-   Page 197. Towards the bottom of the page, "...in an ordinary bagged tree ensemble)." should be "...in an ordinary bagged tree ensemble" (random closing parentheses).

-   Page 276. The last line of Section 7.8 uses notation that's inconsistent with the notation in Section 6.3. In particular, "...to the difference in $f\left(x^\star\right) - E\left[\hat{f}\left(x\right)\right] = 0.51$" should probably be changed to "...to the difference $\hat{f}\left(\boldsymbol{x}^\star\right) - \bar{f} = 0.51$."

-   Page 301. In footnote "w", **sparkR** should be **SparkR** (i.e., it's spelled in upper camel case).
